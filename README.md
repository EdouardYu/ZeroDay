# **ZeroDay - Backend for a Social Network with CTF Challenges**

**ZeroDay** is the backend service for a social networking platform designed as part of the **Software Security project at ISEP**. This platform allows users to connect and participate in **CTF (Capture the Flag)** challenges, exploring and learning about common security vulnerabilities.

---

## **Purpose**
This project simulates real-world security issues to:
1. Enable hands-on practice with vulnerabilities such as CSRF, SSRF, JWT Exploitation, and File Upload Vulnerabilities.
2. Teach secure software development techniques by addressing these vulnerabilities.

## **Frontend Repository**
The frontend for this project is available in a separate repository:

## **CTF Challenges Implemented**

- **CSRF**: Force unwanted actions on authenticated users.
- **SSRF**: Exploit the server to access internal resources.
- **JWT Exploitation**: Manipulate tokens for privilege escalation.
- **File Upload**: Upload malicious scripts disguised as images.
